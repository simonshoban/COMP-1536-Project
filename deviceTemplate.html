					<h1 id="headline">Article of the Day!</h1>
					<p>Fire Emblem Heroes, Nintendo's latest mobile app has captured the hearts of the fans of the franchise along with many new players new to the big title. The game has over 9000 ratings and is easily 10/10 would bang again type of game. It has an extremely shallow depth of gameplay and amazing fan service- Camilia is Simon's favorite girl, aka tittie monster. The game lends itself to rerolling over and over again to obtain the best units currently possible; Ian Lo, the man with the worst luck has spend countless of hours trying to get Lucina along with top teir unitls to no avail. Fire Emblem Heroes has some of the greatests artwork done professionally with amazing voice acting.</p>
					<p>The price for the cyrstal that is required to summon units is quite fair and the increase summon rate for five star unit is a nice touch. I personally rerolled over 100 times just to find the right units and even then, the next set of rolls after the intial is important too. I am just typing random things now to fill this page.......</p>
