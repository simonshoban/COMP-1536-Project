			<h1> Great Reviews - About Us </h1>
			 <p>We are a bunch of computer science students at BCIT who are required 
			 to create a website with full content because the biggest thing we learned 
			 in WebDev is "content is king". This website is our final project that we are 
			 presenting to the rest of the class.</p>

					<h3>Who we are</h3>
					<div><p>We all love to play video games of all genres and on all platforms. We play
					games free2play games, pay2play games and even mobile games that are freemium. We are a 
					group of guys who plays video games through our lives and want to create a webiste that 
					expresses our love for games. That is how we came up with this site, GameReview8.</p></div>
					<h3>Our Reviews</h3>
					<div><p>We decided to create a webiste on game reviews because we believe that the large review 
					sites such as IGN or gamespot give biased review. Somethings their scores reflect how 
					much money the game developers paid them. We at GameReview8 will be as honest as possible 
					and somethings you may disagree with our opinion and thats perfectly normal. We encourage 
					people to discuss about the things we love and argue why the game is either great or you 
					hate it.</p></div>
					<h3>What We Believe In</h3>
					<div><p>We believe in honest reviews and want to develop a community who also shares the 
					same love for video games. We understand that many people will disagree with us and argue but 
					they also have a valid say. We want this site to be the hub where people could come in and 
					openly express their opinions on their favorite games along with us.</p></div>
