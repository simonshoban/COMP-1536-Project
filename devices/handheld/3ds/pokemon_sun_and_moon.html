					<p>Genre: RPG</p>

				<p>After twenty years and six generations, GameFreak has done it again.</p>
				
				<p>This time we start off in the Alola region, a tropical island chain inspired
				by Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands. But this warm and cheery locale hides a grim
				story. The region has been marred by a wave of crime and poverty. One of the cities, 
				Po Town, has been completely walled off after it was taken over by Team Skull, Alola's
				crime syndicate headed by ya boi "destruction in human form" Guzma.</p>
				
				<p>As the Alolan economy stagnates, Professor Kukui of Melemele Island decides that it's
				time for Alola to take it's place on the world stage by creating the Alolan Pokemon League
				to attract wealthy coastal elites from Unova and Kalos to buy overpriced trinkets and take selfies.
				Unfortunately, the best he could get was a psychopathic child from Kanto: you.</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>Good news! Your plot armour is thicker than ever and you always happen to be in the right place
				at the right time! Despite the slow pace and hand-holding at the start of the game, the story is
				surprisingly good. The standard eight Pokemon Gyms have been replaced by the seven Island Trials.
				Although they serve the same purpose, admission into the Pokemon League, they provide fresh content
				for those of us who are tired of the old formula. Each trial consists of some sort of puzzle and then
				a battle with the Totem Pokemon, a larger and much stronger version of it's species. The Totem Pokemon
				can also call for help and summon more Pokemon to join the battle against you. This can lead to some tough
				3 vs 1 situations where sheer power isn't enough to win anymore.</p>

						<figcaption>We're gonna need a bigger Lapras</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>However, this doesn't mean that there aren't any cool trainer battles anymore. In addition to the seven
				Island Trials, there are the four Island Kahunas, one for each island on Alola. These Kahunas can only be battled 
				once you have cleared all the Trials on that particular island. They also each specialize in a certain type, so in
				a way they are just Alolan Gym Leaders. But they get an amazing battle theme, so I guess that makes up for it.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>Now, on to that surpsingly good story I mentioned. You and your mother just moved from Kanto to a small house just
				outside Hau'oli City, the largest city in Alola. Professor Kukui and local rabblerouser Hau are quick to introduce
				themselves and show you around. Hau becomes your rival and best friend but will fall behind in skill because there simply
				isn't enough time in the day to train AND eat malasadas. After starting your Island Challenge, you'll start running into Team
				Skull a lot. Team Skull is probably the most unique of all the evil teams in Pokemon, and you'll find out why rather quickly. 
				One of their enforcers, Gladion, develops a rivalry with you much like how Wally is the true rival in the Hoenn games. I can't
				say much more without ruining the story, but trust me it's better than most Pokemon games.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, the post-game isn't as impressive. In fact, we haven't had an impressive post-game since Black and White 2
				in 2012. There IS a series of missions in the post-game involving the Ultra Beasts and Detective Looker, but it's even shorter 
				and significantly less meaningful than the Looker Bureau missions in the XY post-game. Sun and Moon throw lots of cameos at you
				throughout the story like Sina and Dexio asking you to help them find Zygarde Cores. All these special characters appear at the 
				Battle Tree on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is basically the Battle Tower but with more special battles. There's at least one special
				character from each game in the series, this is the 20th anniversary of the series after all. Some of them look just like how you
				last saw them, some have aged, and some have become enlightened by their own intelligence.</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>So we have a pretty overworld, a story that's rivalled only by Black and White, unusually good battle
				music, and a weak post-game. I certainly enjoyed the game and felt that I got my money's worth out of it, and I think you would too.</p>
